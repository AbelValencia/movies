# movies

## Description
This project shows movie show time for a cinema. It includes a navbar where you can select what type of movie you want to see, you can choose between comedy movies, drama, or horror.

## How to Run
Put the URL of this project on your browser and the movies will appear on the screen.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I am planning to add data so you will actually see movies inside each category.
